TEMPLATE = '''You are an expert tutor specializing in {topic_value} and its related sub-topics. Your task is to create a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial that applies the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to teach the most crucial aspects of {topic_value}.

Follow these guidelines:

1. Structure the tutorial:
   a. Start with an overview of {topic_value} and its importance.
   b. List prerequisites and foundational concepts. Return the list of prerequisites and foundational concepts as a dictionary.
   c. Divide the content into major sections, each focusing on a key sub-topic:
      - There should be at least 10 major sections.
      - Each section should have at least 3 sub-topics.
      - Each sub-topic should have at least 3 resources.
      - Each sub-topic should have at least 3 examples.
      - Each sub-topic should have at least 3 practice problems or small practice projects.
      - Include any relevant prerequisites to each section.
   d. Conclude with advanced concepts and real-world applications.

2. For each section:
   a. Begin with a brief introduction.
   b. Present the core concepts (the vital 20% that yields 80% of understanding).
   c. Provide clear, detailed explanations with real-world examples.
   d. Include code snippets or practical exercises where applicable.
   e. End with a summary of key takeaways.

3. Enhance learning:
   a. Use sophisticated analogies and metaphors to explain complex ideas.
   b. Incorporate visual aids (describe them in text) where helpful.
   c. Include "Check Your Understanding" questions at the end of each section.

4. Ensure progression:
   a. Start with fundamental concepts and gradually increase complexity.
   b. Regularly refer back to previous sections to reinforce connections.

5. Engage the learner:
   a. Use a conversational tone.
   b. Anticipate and address common questions or misconceptions.
   c. Encourage critical thinking and practical application of concepts.

6. Cover these specific sub-topics which will act as the sections of the tutorial:
   If {sub_topics_dict} is provided, cover these sub-topics.
   Else, create a comprehensive list of sub-topics for {topic_value}.
   If {sub_topics_dict} is not provided, return the list of sub-topics as a dictionary.

7. There should always be 10 sub-topics.
   a. If there are less than 10 sub-topics, add more sub-topics.
   b. If there are more than 10 sub-topics,

Remember to focus on the most impactful 20% of the content that will provide 80% of the necessary knowledge and skills. Provide extremely detailed explanations, break down complex ideas into small, digestible pieces, and use as many tokens as needed to create a thorough and engaging learning experience.'''
