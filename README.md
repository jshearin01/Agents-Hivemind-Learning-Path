# Agents-and-AI-Portfolio

This is a space to demonstrate and enhance eachother's knowledge of building tools with LLMs and Agents.

Think of it not as a repository to build examples and tools, but a classroom where we are all the teachers and the students, working together to build the coursework and show eachother new techniques that we've learned and want to share.

What has worked for you, what hasn't worked for you and what did you do to find a better way, what did you wish you knew 6 months ago?

Please create a personal folder for any contributions, or create a shared folder that will be used to create a hive-mind of knowledge and resources.
